# EAI320_Practical4
The goal of this assignment is to implement a naïve Bayes classifier. The naïve Bayes
classifier is an algorithm that solves classification problems by making a simple assumption:
that all features in the input vector f are conditionally independent given the class. Although
this assumption does not always hold, naïve Bayes classifiers have been widely used and have
shown to perform well on a variety of tasks
